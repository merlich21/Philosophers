# Philosophers

Summary: In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. 
You will see how to create threads and you will discover mutexes.

Overview

________________________________________________________________________________________
Here are the things you need to know if you want to succeed this assignment:
• One or more philosophers sit at a round table.

There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

• The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.

While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

• There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.

• Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

• When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.

• Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

• Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

• Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

• No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!

Global rules
________________________________________________________________________________________
You have to write a program for the mandatory part and another one for the bonus part
(if you decide to do the bonus part). They both have to comply with the following rules:

• Global variables are forbidden!

• The program should take the following arguments:

number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]

◦ number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and also the number
of forks.

◦ time_to_die (in milliseconds): If a philosopher didn’t start eating time_to_die
milliseconds since the beginning of their last meal or the beginning of the simulation, they die.

◦ time_to_eat (in milliseconds): The time it takes for a philosopher to eat.
During that time, they will need to hold two forks.

◦ time_to_sleep (in milliseconds): The time a philosopher will spend sleeping.

◦ number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat (optional argument): If all
philosophers have eaten at least number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat
times, the simulation stops. If not specified, the simulation stops when a
philosopher dies.

• Each philosopher has a number ranging from 1 to number_of_philosophers.

• Philosopher number 1 sits next to philosopher number number_of_philosophers.
Any other philosopher number N sits between philosopher number N - 1 and philosopher number N + 1.

About the logs of the program:
________________________________________________________________________________________
• Any state change of a philosopher must be formatted as follows:

◦ timestamp_in_ms X has taken a fork

◦ timestamp_in_ms X is eating

◦ timestamp_in_ms X is sleeping

◦ timestamp_in_ms X is thinking

◦ timestamp_in_ms X died

Replace timestamp_in_ms with the current timestamp in milliseconds
and X with the philosopher number.

• A displayed state message should not be mixed up with another message.

• A message announcing a philosopher died should be displayed no more than 10 ms
after the actual death of the philosopher.

• Again, philosophers should avoid dying!
